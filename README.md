JenkinsJobs
===========

Python scripts and config.xml files for various jobs on the Bradner Lab Jenkins server.

Jenkins (http://jenkins-ci.org/) is a continous integration server.  Jenkins is flexible and can also serve as a cron replacement and can run arbitrary jobs.  Jenkins can provide a simple GUI wrapper around command line programs, and also provides easy email, archiving, and logging capabilities.

Most of these Jenkins jobs will be centered around automating (as much as possible) the process from genome sequence data to useful plots to help Cancer researchers.
